# Adjective order

This repository contains my ongoing work for my master thesis at Utrecht University.

### How do I view or run the code?

Most of the code is written in Julia using Pluto notebooks. While you can read the raw code, I recommend using the [github page](https://lukavdplas.github.io/adjective-order/) of this repository, which contains a static rendered version of each notebook. This is the easiest and quickest way to view the code, complete with output, plots and documentation âœ¨

If you want to run the code yourself, you will have to install Julia. You can run each notebook as a Julia script, but I recommend installing Pluto. See instructions [here](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl#lets-do-it).
